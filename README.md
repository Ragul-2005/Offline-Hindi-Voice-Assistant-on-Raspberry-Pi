## 📌 Overview

<p align="justify">
This project presents a <b>fully offline Hindi Voice Assistant</b> designed to run entirely on a Raspberry Pi without any cloud dependency. The system performs on-device speech recognition, intent processing, and text-to-speech synthesis, ensuring <b>user privacy, low latency, and edge-AI compatibility</b>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The solution addresses challenges in regional language voice interfaces by supporting Hindi speech input and output, optimized for CPU-only ARM environments. The assistant is suitable for deployment in smart homes, assistive technologies, public kiosks, and rural or low-connectivity regions.
